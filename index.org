* C++ and Finance

Python and R are great languages for prototyping and for production tasks where speed is not an issue.  However, when you need an rock-solid, fast, and established language you can beat C++.  C++ is widely used in finance for:

- Derivative (Option) Pricing
- HFT
- Portfolio Construction and Stress Testing
- Term Structure Modeling
